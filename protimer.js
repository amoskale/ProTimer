//ProTimer, a JavaScript powerful timer class.
//Native JavaScript (no jQuery, Prototype nor any other script required).
//Works on old and mobile browsers (only based on the setTimeout function).
//Timers are autoplayable, pausable, stoppable and loopable. They handle "this" arguments for callbacks.

//Constructor : takes its parameters as an object
//Required properties : delay (in milliseconds), callback (function)
//Optional properties : thisArg (defaults to window), loop (boolean, defaults to true), autoplay (boolean, defaults to true)
//The timer will call the specified callback after the specified delay, possibly in loop and with a "this" argument
//If autoplay!==false the constructor automatically runs the timeout, else you will need to call the play method.
function Timer(args) {
	this.delay=args.delay;
	this.callback=args.callback;
	this.thisArg=(typeof args.thisArg!="undefined")?args.thisArg:window;
	this.loop=(typeof args.loop!="undefined")?args.loop:true;
	this.paused=false;
	this.active=false;
	if(args.autoplay!==false) this.play();
}

//play() : Runs the timer if it's not runned or if it's paused or stopped
//If the timer was paused, runs the timer so that it callbacks after the remaining time there was when it was paused
//(this is the difference between pause and stop, if it's stopped it will simply callback after the normal delay).
Timer.prototype.play=function() {
	if(this.active) {
		if(this.paused) {
			this.timeout=setTimeout(this.trigger.bind(this),this.delay-this.pausedTime+this.playedTime);

			this.paused=false;
		}
	}
	else {
		this.timeout=setTimeout(this.trigger.bind(this),this.delay);
		this.playedTime=Date.now();
		this.paused=false;

//Resume with the play method.

//stop() : Stops the timer.
//Restart with the play method.
Timer.prototype.stop=function() {
	this.paused=false;
	this.active=false;
